- 08/24/2022 - Added Snyk (https://snyk.io/) to project. We'll look into deploying the task scheduling UI on a public-facing endpoint (i.e website). Snyk will keep it safe and continuously pentest and read our code to find vulnerabilities to report. No reason to add it now; I had no other public repo to test Snyk integration.
